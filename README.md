# 👋 Hello World👋 
> [!WARNING]
> **I Love to Learn New Things**
 ## I’m @ZavierChambers and I am a dual degree student at *Duquesne University* earning two degrees in **Computer Science and Cybersecurity** respectively. 
####  - 👀 I’m interested in using my knowledge to aid in future projects and possibly receive aid from others who see the goal I am aiming to achieve in my projects.
#### - 🌱 I’m currently learning Java development as well as C++ in my education path, so I tend to enjoy statically typed programming. I love to discover bugs within code as it challenges me to fix them but also, it gives me the ability to express my creativity. 
#### - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are related to IT at the same time as any project that I may have a personal interest in.
#### - 📫 If you desire to get ahold of me for a collaboration I would like to point you to my email chambersz@duq.edu
> [!NOTE]
>  This is a great chance for me to say **Thank You** for learning about me and I hope one day we can get together and fix the world's issues, one line at a time.
